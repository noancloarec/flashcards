            "question": "Would you use different pub-sub instances for different projects ?",
            "answer": "No, only one pub-sub for an organization, then you will create topics to separate data"
        },
        {
            "question": "In Pub Sub, what is the difference between the push and pull delivery ?",
            "answer": "In pull delivery, the subscriber will ask pub sub what are the new messages whereas in push delivery the subscriber will have a webhook called by pub sub so that delivery is almost instantaneous."
        },
        {
            "question": "In Pub Sub, what happens if a subscriber never sends acknowledgements after receiving messages ?",
            "answer": "The message is considered outstanding and will be redelivered after a certain amount of time, which grows exponentially with the number of retries."
        },
        {
            "question": "In Pub Sub, can one subscription have many subscribers ?",
            "answer": "Yes"

            "question": "In Pub Sub, by default how long are messages conserved ?",
            "answer": "For 7 days"
        },
        {
            "question": "In DataFlow, what is a watermark ?",
            "answer": "It is a threshold that indicates when DataFlow expects all of the data in a window to have arrived."
        },
        {
            "question": "What timestamp does DataFlow take for an event to decide which window to put it in ?",
            "answer": "The event creation time, may be generated by pub-sub or user-provided."
        },
        {
            "question": "How to handle late event in DataFlow when we do not want to set a too big watermark ?",
            "answer": "By setting up a trigger which will fire early, at the watermark, and when late data arrives."
        },

            "question": "What does ACID mean ?",

        {
            "question": "What is Colossus ?",
            "answer": "It is the Google File System that powers several Google Cloud products such as Cloud Storage or Big Table"

        {
            "question": "What is the most important thing to do when designing BigTable schema regarding performance ?",
            "answer": "Designing the key so that reads and writes are shared evenly accross the key range, and that one read does not require many tablets to be read"
        },
        {
            "question": "In BigTable, what can you do to optimize performance if most requests concern recent data ?",
            "answer": "Use reverse timestamp as they key so that the most recent records are at the top of the file."
        },
        {
            "question": "In BigTable, at which level is an operation atomic ?",
            "answer": "At the row level, i.e. if an operation over 2 rows modifies one row and fails at the 2nd the change on the first row won't be reversed as in common ACID db systems"
        },
        {
            "question": "In BigTable, what is a column family ?",
            "answer": "A set of column in a table that are often queried together, grouping these columns well can help to limit what you're pulling back"
        },
        {
            "question": "What does BigTable do to automatically optimize performance ?",
            "answer": "It scans your access patterns and distribute data (or pointers to data) accross nodes in the cluster to distribute workloads evenly."
